# 🌟 Personal Portfolio Website

This is my **Personal Portfolio Website**, designed to present my professional journey, skills, and achievements in an attractive and user-friendly way.  
The primary goal of this portfolio is to create a strong online presence and give visitors a clear understanding of who I am and what I do. It includes a clean and modern design with smooth animations, optimized performance, and a fully responsive layout that adapts to any device – whether it’s a smartphone, tablet, or desktop.

I built this project with **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**, focusing on simplicity, performance, and accessibility. Hosting is handled through **Netlify**, ensuring fast and secure content delivery.  
This portfolio not only reflects my technical skills but also my attention to detail, design aesthetics, and passion for delivering high-quality work.
